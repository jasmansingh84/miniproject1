# Git Commands and Terminologies

  ## Repository
      
A repository is like a folder for your project. Your project's repository contains all of your project's files and 
stores each file's revision history.You can own repositories individually, or you can share ownership of repositories 
with other people in an organization.

 ## Clone
  
Git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone or copy of a target 
Repository.

 ## Fork
 
A fork is a copy of a repository that you manage. Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository.
You can fetch updates from or submit changes to the original repository with pull requests.


## Branch

A branch is a parallel version of a repository. Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches.
You can merge a branch into another branch using a pull request.

## Commit

A commit is an individual change to a file (or set of files). Git assigns each commit a unique ID, called a SHA or hash.

## Merge

Merge a pull request into the upstream branch when work is completed. Anyone with push access to the repository can complete the merge.

## Checkout

The checkout command lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch . Checking out a branch updates the files in the
working directory to match the version stored in that branch, and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch.
