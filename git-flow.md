# Gitflow Workflow

Gitflow Workflow is a design that was first published and made popular by Vincent Driessen at nvie. The Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. This provides a robust framework for managing larger projects.  

Gitflow is ideally suited for projects that have a scheduled release cycle. This workflow doesn’t add any new concepts or commands beyond what’s required for the Feature Branch Workflow. Instead, it assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact. In addition to feature branches, it uses individual branches for preparing, maintaining, and recording releases. Of course, you also get to leverage all the benefits of the Feature Branch Workflow: pull requests, isolated experiments, and more efficient collaboration.

## How it works

This workflow uses two branches to record the history of the project. The master branch stores the official release history, and the develop branch serves as an integration branch for features. It's also convenient to tag all commits in the master branch with a version number.A simple way to do this is for one developer to create an empty develop branch locally and push it to the server.


This branch will contain the complete history of the project, whereas master will contain an abridged version. Other developers should now clone the central repository and create a tracking branch for develop.When using the git-flow extension library, executing git flow init on an existing repo will create the develop branch

## Feature Branches

Each new feature should reside in its own branch, which can be pushed to the central repository for backup/collaboration. But, instead of branching off of master, feature branches use develop as their parent branch. When a feature is complete, it gets merged back into develop. Features should never interact directly with master.

## Creating a feature branch

Without the git-flow extensions:
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature_branch

When using the git-flow extension:
git flow feature start feature_branch

## Finishing a feature branch
When you’re done with the development work on the feature, the next step is to merge the feature_branch into develop.
